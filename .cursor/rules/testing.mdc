After making any changes to Ruby files, run the following command from the project root to verify the script still works
and that the output wasn't broken (for example, if no slides were produced):

```
./scripts/to-mdx/bin/to-mdx --use-heuristics ~/Desktop/Building\ resilient\ systems.odp
```

If refactoring code, there should be no changes to `src/pages/presentations/2019-04-17_building_resilient_systems.mdx`
which you can verify with `git diff`. If any changes do occur, check in with the user to make sure they're correct.
