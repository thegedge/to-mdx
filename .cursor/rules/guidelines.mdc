- Never hardcode values that can be found in either the `styles.xml` or `content.xml` files in the ODP archive
- Don't write code comments. Focus on code that's easy to read. If functions get large, extract smaller subfunctions and
  give them a good name.
- Never use the `any` type. If you struggle with figuring out a type, ask the user.
